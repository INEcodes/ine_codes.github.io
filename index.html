            <h3>Natural Language Processing + Sanskrit TTS</h3>
            <p>Collaborated in the development of a Language Guessing Program for the Android Club VIT, involving 30 team members and targeting 5 languages. 
               Integrated Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models to innovate the solution, enhancing program capabilities through the incorporation of 3 Python-based machine learning models. 
               As a dedicated contributor, the experience not only enriched technical skills but also solidified commitment to making impactful contributions in AI and machine learning projects, collaborating with 29 other members. 
               Implemented over 3 transliteration methods to achieve accurate results for Sanskrit speech recognition from text. 
               Collaborated with Google Translation and Microsoft Azure environments to develop a text-to-speech system with 90% accuracy.

            <h3>OpenCV-Based Face Detection System with MySQL Database (Aug 2023- Nov 2023) + Optical Character Recognition (Apr 2024)</h3>
            <p>Led a 5-member team in developing a 95% accurate facial recognition system using Python, OpenCV, MySQL, and Tkinter, overseeing a dataset of 13,000 images. 
                Achieved precision via algorithm tuning and advanced image processing, optimizing the model with a substantial dataset, requiring only 1 image to process. 
                Deployed a comprehensive technology stack to craft an efficient, user-friendly solution, prioritizing seamless GUI integration and robust data privacy measures, achieving a 3% faster performance than the previous version. 
                Expanded the usability of the software by adding Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to my face detection project. Achieved a 30% improvement in functionality by working in a team and contributing to open-source projects, including the development of a graphic user interface.</p>
